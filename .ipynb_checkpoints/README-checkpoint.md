 A simple cat or dog classifier using logistic regression with a neural network mindset.
 
 A beginner's way for getting started into neural networks and deep learning.
 
 Dataset --> [Cat and Dog](https://www.kaggle.com/tongpython/cat-and-dog)
 
 From the original dataset, I have selected 1500 images of each cats and dogs and put in the training_set directory. And 250 images of each in the test_set  directory.
 That makes the dataset consisting of 3000 training examples and 500 test examples.
